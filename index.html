              <p>
                As players of Monster Hunter and Dungeons & Dragons know, the
                slime is not exactly the king of the fantasy monsters. So when a
                37-year-old Tokyo salaryman dies and wakes up in a world of
                dragons and magic, he’s a little disappointed to find he’s
                become a blind, boneless slime monster. Mikami’s middle age
                hasn’t gone as he planned: He never found a girlfriend, he got
                stuck in a dead-end job, and he was abruptly stabbed to death in
                the street at 37. So when he wakes up in a new world straight
                out of a fantasy RPG, he’s disappointed but not exactly
                surprised to find that he’s not a knight or a wizard but a blind
                slime demon. But there are chances for even a slime to become a
                hero…
